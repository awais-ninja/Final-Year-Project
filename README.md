# SwiftLink

SwiftLink is a comprehensive freight transportation system designed to provide efficient and reliable logistics and transportation services. This project was created by Awais Ahmad as a Final Year Project for the University of Sahiwal, Sahiwal.

## Technologies Used

SwiftLink utilizes a variety of technologies to ensure performance, scalability, and maintainability:

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows us to create dynamic and interactive web applications with ease.
- **Next.js**: A React framework that enables server-side rendering and static site generation. Next.js helps in optimizing the performance of our web applications and improves SEO.
- **PostgreSQL**: A powerful, open-source relational database system. PostgreSQL is used for storing and managing all the data related to our logistics operations.
- **Redis**: An in-memory data structure store used as a database, cache, and message broker. Redis helps in speeding up data access and improving the overall performance of the platform.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs. Tailwind CSS allows us to create a consistent and responsive design across the platform.
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine. Node.js is used for building the backend services of SwiftLink.
- **Express.js**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework. Express.js provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
- **Docker**: A set of platform-as-a-service products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers. Docker helps in managing our applications in isolated environments.
- **AWS**: Amazon Web Services provides reliable and scalable cloud computing services. We use AWS for hosting, storage, and other cloud services.

## Key Features

- **User-friendly Interface**: SwiftLink offers a simple and intuitive interface for users to easily manage their logistics needs.
- **Real-time Tracking**: Track shipments and vehicles in real-time to ensure timely deliveries and transparency.
- **Efficient Routing**: Our platform uses advanced algorithms to optimize routes and reduce transportation costs.
- **Scalable Infrastructure**: With the use of modern technologies and cloud services, SwiftLink can scale to meet increasing demands.
